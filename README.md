# Clicker

The Clicker app represented here was created as I was developing my skills with Flutter and Dart. 

This program uses Flutter to create a simple clicker, something that can record instances of when you performn a certain behavior or say a word or phrase, for use in documenting how often this happens.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code has extensions that help when working on Dart and Flutter projects, and said extensionos also intigrate with other software to help.

Testing on this project was primarily done through iOS, using my personal phone. To do this, and also secondary testing on MacOS, Xcode was also used as the intermediary to read the swift code generated. AndroidStudio was also intigrated to use the Kotlin code, and ChromeOS was used as well.
